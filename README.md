## Metadata
- `demographic.json`: file contains demographic information for each station in the following format:
    ```
    {
        sno: the station ID number for each bike station in string
            {
                "sna": the name of the station in Traditional Chinese,
                "sarea": the district of the station in Traditional Chinese,
                "lat": the latitude of the station in float,
                "lng": the longtitude of the station in float,
                "ar": the address of the station in Traditinal Chinese,
                "sareaen": the district of the station in English,
                "aren": the address of the staion in English,
            }
    ...
    }
    ```
- `sno_test_set.txt`: contains the stations' `sno` that needs to predict in the test set
- `release/$date`: directory for all training data, where the `$date` is in YYYYMMDD format
    - in each directory contains `${sno}.json` files, which record the data of each station with number `$sno` of the coresponding date in the following format:
    ```
    {
        timestamp: string in 24-hour format (HH:MM)
            {
                "tot": maximum capacity number of the station at the minute, integers > 0
                "sbi": the current bike amount of the station at the minute, integers >= 0
                "bemp": the number of slots available for parking bikes at the minute, integers >= 0
                "act": whether the station is open to use at the minute, where "1" means open and "0" means prohibited, strings
            }
        ...
    }
    ```
    - we will update `release/` on a daily base.
- `sample_submission_stage${i}.csv`: sample submission for each stage in csv format, e.g.
    ```
    id,sbi
    20231021_500101001_06:40,7.89
    ...
    ```
    The first row of your submission must be `id,sbi`, the following rows must contain 2 columns and seperated by `,`. The first column is the id of your prediction in `YYYYMMDD_${sno}_HH:MM`, where `${sno}` must be one of the station number appears in `sno_test_set.txt`, `YYYYMMDD` indicates the format of date, and `HH:MM` is the format of time. (`Y`=year, `M`=month, `D`=day, `H`=hour, `M`=minute). The second column is your bike amount prediction of the bike station at the given timestamp, it can be integer or float. The number of rows should be equal to **88705**, that is, **1** row of `id,sbi` and **88704** rows of predictions (112 stations $\times$ 3 predictions per hour $\times$ 24 hours $\times$ (4 days in public set period + 7 days in private set period).
