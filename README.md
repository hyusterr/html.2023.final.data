            "sna": the name of the station in Traditional Chinese,
            "sarea": the district of the station in Traditional Chinese,

            "aren": the address of the staion in English,
        }
 ...
}
```
- `sno_test_set.txt`: contains the stations' `sno` that needs to predict in the test set
- `release/$date`: directory for all training data, where the $date is in YYYYMMDD format
    - in each directory contains `${sno}.json` files, which record the data of each station with number `$sno` of the coresponding date in the following format:
    ```
    {
        timestamp: string in 24-hour format (HH:MM)
            {
                "tot": maximum capacity number of the station at the minute, integars > 0
                "sbi": the current bike amount of the station at the minute, integars >= 0
                "bemp": the number of slots available for parking bikes at the minute, integars >= 0
                "act": whether the station is open to use at the minute, where "1" means open and "0" means prohibited, strings
